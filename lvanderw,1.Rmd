## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
Aircraftdata <- read.csv("AVP1.csv")#Importing a file from excel in .csv file format
Aircraftdata#expressing the data to be seen
```
```{r}
V <- Aircraftdata[,6]#Isolating a column variable of the data
MV <- mean(V) #Calculating the mean of that variable
cat("The mean Velocity is ", MV, "ft/s") #Printing a statement as a descriptive summary

```
```{r}
a<-Aircraftdata[,2]# Isolating the Angle of attack variable
summary(a)#Getting descriptive summary of that variable in the dataset
```
```{r}
ma<-max(a)#Finding the max angle of attack
cat("The stall angle will happen at max angle of attack which is at",ma,"degrees")
#Printing a statement as a descriptive summary
```
```{r}
summary(Aircraftdata)# Getting a descriptive summary of the entire data

```
```{r}
Period <- Aircraftdata[,1]#Isolating the time varibale
plot(Period,a,
     main = "Angle of Attack vs.Time",
     xlab ="Period in seconds",
     ylab = "Angle of Attack in degrees")
```
```{r}
plot(Period,V,
     main = "Velocity vs. Time",
     xlab = "Time in sec",
     ylab = "Velocity in ft/s" )
```
```{r}
plot(Period,V,
     main = "Velocity vs. Time",
     xlab = "Time in sec",
     ylab = "Velocity in ft/s" )
#Plotting the time varible vs. the velocity variable in the data, added a graph title with an x and y label
```
```{r}
CA <- Aircraftdata[,5]
plot(CA,a,main = "Climb angle vs. Angle of Attack",
     col.main="red",
     xlab = "Climb Angle",
     ylab = "Angle of Attack",)
#Plotting the time varible vs. the velocity variable in the data, added a graph title (coloured red) with an x and y label
```
